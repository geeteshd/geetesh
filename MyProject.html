      <p class="First">
        Agriculture plays a major role in Indian Economy. The crop yield depends
        upon the pesticides and fertilizers applied in the fields. But the
        manual handling of these things leads to health hazards. The World
        Health Organization (WHO) estimated that over 3 million cases of
        pesticides poison each year, which is majority in developing countries
        like India. This paper aims to overcome the problem by automating the
        spray of pesticides and fertilizers in the fields. The system is
        constituted by an aerial sprayer which consists of a Quadcopter and
        spraying mechanism. The Quadcopter is controlled by the Radio Frequency
        signals and the spraying of pesticides is achieved with less manual
        labor without any health issues. This paper is to mainly overcome the
        ill-effects of pesticides on human beings and also to cover larger areas
        with short span of time.

      <p class="Second">
        Day by day the population of India is increasing and to full fill the
        necessity of food modernization of agricultural sectors square measure
        vital because of chemical fertilizers the fertility mechanization in
        spraying devices fertilizers and pesticides square measure distributed
        equally on the farm and scale back the number of waste, which ends in
        hindrance of losses and it's going to be terribly important to boost the
        performance and productivity of agriculture through at the same time
        supply secure cultivation of the farmers. Although spraying of
        pesticides has become obligatory it additionally proves to be a harmful
        procedure for the farmers. Farmers, particularly once they spray
        pesticides, take too several precautions like carrying appropriate
        outfits, masks, gloves etc. so as that, it doesn't motive any harmful
        results on them. Zero million humans are afflicted by extreme poisoning
        and its fee is 2-three in step with minute, with close to twenty,000
        folks ending from exposure per annum, it'll Mechanization offers higher
        productivity in stripped-down enter. Farmers square measure the
        utilization of the same ancient ways for spraying fertilizers and
        pesticides. There is a wish of development during this quarter and most
        commonly on fertilizers pesticides spraying technique because it needs
        larger efforts and time to spray by mistreatment typical manner.

      <ul class="Third"> 
        <li>To accumulate the drone the use of crucial components.</li>
        <li>
          To design a mechanism for spraying and managing parameters like
          spraying pace manage, monitoring tank status, deliver a
          pesticide/fertilizer spraying tank on it and maybe pass across the
          fields, change the height of spraying the usage of liner traversing
          mechanisms, this can permit the advanced system to spray at
          distinctive heights for one among a kind plants and so forth.
        </li>
        <li>To sprinkle chemicals or insecticides or pesticides aerially.</li>
        <li>
          To construct this machine in such a way that it can travel across any
          type of terrain.
        </li>
        <li>
          To make this machine solar powered, so that it can be readily charged
